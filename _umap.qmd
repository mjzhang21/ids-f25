### Introduction

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), introduced by 
Leland McInnes, John Healy, and James Melville in 2018 
[@mcinnes2020umapuniformmanifoldapproximation], is a powerful dimensionality
reduction technique designed to visualize high-dimensional data in a 
low-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D. Unlike linear methods like PCA, 
UMAP captures nonlinear structures, preserving local clusters while also 
maintaining the overall global patterns of the data.
