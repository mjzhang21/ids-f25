### Introduction

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) was introduced by 
Leland McInnes, John Healy, and James Melville in 2018
[@mcinnes2020umapuniformmanifoldapproximation]. UMAP is a powerful dimensionality
reduction technique designed to visualize high-dimensional data in a 
low-dimensional space, such as 2D or 3D. Unlike linear methods like PCA, 
UMAP captures nonlinear structures, preserving local clusters while also 
maintaining the overall global patterns of the data. UMAP is utilized for
clustering, data visualization, and data exploration.


### Other Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

#### Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- linear technique; projects data along directions of maximum variance
- Preserves global structure fairly well but may lose local neighborhood 
  details.
- good for visualization of 2-3 PCs but cannot capture nonlinear
  structures.


#### t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- finds distances between pairs of points, maps onto t dist.
- nonlinear technique; preserves local structure very well.
- can distort global relationships
- often slower than UMAP for large datasets
